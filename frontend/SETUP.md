# Frontend Project Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (version matching the `sdk` in `pubspec.yaml`)
- Dart SDK (if not included with Flutter)
- Android Studio or VS Code (recommended)
- Git

## Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Run the app (choose your platform):
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

## Additional Notes
- If you add new packages, run `flutter pub get` again.
- For Android/iOS builds, ensure you have the respective SDKs and emulators installed.
- If you face issues, check the official Flutter documentation: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
